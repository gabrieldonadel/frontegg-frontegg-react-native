[Frontegg](https://frontegg.com/) is a self-served user management platform for modern SaaS
applications. Drop this SDK in and your app gets a production login screen, a live session, and a
user object — without you writing an auth flow or touching a token.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Hosted or embedded login** | Frontegg's login box, or your own UI on top of the API |
| **Every method your tenants need** | Email, social, SSO, magic link, passkeys, MFA and step-up |
| **Sessions that stay alive** | Tokens refresh in the background, on both platforms |
| **Built for multi-tenant SaaS** | Multi-tenancy, RBAC, entitlements and multi-region support |

## Install

```sh
npm install @frontegg/react-native
```

Then the peer dependencies:

```sh
# Expo
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

# Bare React Native
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

**Requirements:** React Native 0.63+ · iOS deployment target 14+ · Android API 26+ with JDK 17 and
AGP 7.4+. Passkeys additionally need iOS 15+ and Chrome Custom Tabs on Android.

## Quick start

**1 · Allow the redirect URLs.** In the Frontegg Portal, under **[ENVIRONMENT] → Authentication →
Login method**, turn hosted login on and add the shared URL plus one per platform:

```
{{FRONTEGG_BASE_URL}}/oauth/authorize

# iOS
{{IOS_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}}://{{FRONTEGG_BASE_URL}}/ios/oauth/callback

# Android
{{ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME}}://{{FRONTEGG_BASE_URL}}/android/oauth/callback
https://{{FRONTEGG_BASE_URL}}/oauth/account/redirect/android/{{ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME}}
```

**2 · Configure the native projects.** iOS reads a `Frontegg.plist`; Android takes its domain and
client ID from `build.gradle`. Both are covered step by step in the
[Setup guide](https://react-native-guide.frontegg.com/#/setup) — this is the one part that is not
JavaScript, and it differs per platform.

**3 · Wrap your app.**

```tsx
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { FronteggWrapper } from '@frontegg/react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <FronteggWrapper>
      <NavigationContainer>
        {/* your navigator */}
      </NavigationContainer>
    </FronteggWrapper>
  );
}
```

**4 · Read the authentication state** anywhere below it.

```tsx
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useAuth, login } from '@frontegg/react-native';

export function MyScreen() {
  const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth();

  return (
    <View>
      {isAuthenticated ? <Profile /> : <Button title="Login" onPress={login} />}
    </View>
  );
}
```
